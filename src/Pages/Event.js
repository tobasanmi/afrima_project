            <p>
              FACE IT is an acronym coined by the International Committee of
              AFRIMA. It represents the core values of the All Africa Music
              Awards which are: Fairness, Authenticity, Creativity, Excellence,
              Integrity and Transparency. The AFRIMA Mantra: “FOR HOPE, FOR
              CELEBRATION” revolves round the universal power of music as a tool
              of hope and unity in the African continent despite the challenges
              it faces.
